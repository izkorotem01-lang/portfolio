# Video Loading Fix - Portfolio Section

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Sequential Video Loading

**Problem**: All videos in the portfolio section were trying to load simultaneously, overwhelming the network and browser.

**Solution**: Implemented a sequential video loading system using a new custom hook `use-sequential-video-loader.tsx`.

**How it works**:

- Videos are loaded one after another in a queue
- On desktop: Loads 4 videos initially, then loads 2 at a time concurrently
- On mobile: Loads 2 videos initially, then loads 1 at a time for better performance
- Each video is shown as soon as it finishes loading
- Users see a loading indicator showing progress (e.g., "Loading 3 of 15")

### 2. ✅ Mobile Video Loading

**Problem**: Videos weren't loading on mobile devices but worked fine on PC.

**Solution**: Multiple improvements for mobile compatibility:

1. **Better preload strategy**:

   - Start with `preload="none"`
   - Change to `preload="auto"` only when the video's turn comes in the queue
   - This prevents mobile browsers from blocking all video loads at once

2. **iOS Safari compatibility**:

   - Added `playsInline` attribute (crucial for iOS)
   - Set `controls={false}` to prevent native controls
   - Added `disablePictureInPicture` and `disableRemotePlayback`
   - Proper muted autoplay handling

3. **Progressive loading**:
   - Videos load sequentially instead of all at once
   - Reduced concurrent loads on mobile (1 vs 2 on desktop)
   - Better memory management

## Technical Changes

### New File: `src/hooks/use-sequential-video-loader.tsx`

A custom React hook that manages video loading state and queuing:

- Tracks loading state for each video (loading, loaded, canLoad)
- Manages a queue of videos waiting to load
- Automatically triggers next video load when current one finishes
- Different settings for mobile vs desktop

### Modified: `src/components/sections/PortfolioSection.tsx`

1. Integrated the sequential video loader hook
2. Updated video element attributes for better mobile support
3. Added proper event listeners for `canplaythrough` and `error`
4. Implemented visual loading indicators showing progress
5. Better autoplay handling after videos finish loading

## Key Features

### Desktop Experience

- Loads 4 videos immediately for quick initial display
- Then loads 2 videos concurrently for balanced performance
- Smooth transitions as each video becomes available

### Mobile Experience

- Loads 2 videos immediately (reduced from desktop's 4)
- Then loads 1 video at a time to prevent memory issues
- Optimized for mobile network constraints
- Compatible with iOS Safari autoplay policies

### User Feedback

- Loading placeholders with animated icons
- Progress counter (e.g., "Loading 5 of 20")
- Smooth fade-in when videos are ready (opacity transition)
- Videos without thumbnails autoplay muted when loaded

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Desktop**: Test with 10+ videos to see sequential loading in action
2. **Mobile**: Test on actual iOS and Android devices, not just browser dev tools
3. **Network throttling**: Test with slow 3G to see progressive loading
4. **Different categories**: Ensure video loading resets when changing categories

## Performance Impact

- **Reduced initial bandwidth**: Only loads 2-4 videos instead of all at once
- **Better memory usage**: Especially on mobile devices
- **Improved perceived performance**: Users see videos appearing progressively
- **No blocking**: Network isn't overwhelmed by simultaneous requests
